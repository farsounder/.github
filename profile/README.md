Thanks for dropping by! FarSounder makes 3D Forward Looking Sonar products for navigation. Our main Software is SonaSoft, it looks like this:

Our sensor looks forward in 3D and detects hazards to navigation and the seafloor. You can read more on our [website](https://www.farsounder.com/) or our [techblog](https://www.farsounder.com/blog). If you're looking for examples
for how to integrate our sonar data into your system, you can find them in this [repo](https://github.com/farsounder/SDKMessageExample)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at service@farsounder.com.
